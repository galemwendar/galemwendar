#### Hi there! 👋 I'm @galemwendar

- 🚀 C# Developer since 2021
- 💼 I mainly work with technologies such as .NET, Entity Framework, WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET, Linux.
- 🛠️ Currently working on ERP systems based on C# such as DirectumRX
- 💡 I'm thinking about trying to write my own backend for llama.cpp since the existing ones somehow do not suit me in some way, and the task itself looks curious
